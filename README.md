# 📊 Bharat Herald — Media Survival Analysis

A complete analysis of Bharat Herald’s **operational and financial performance (2019–2024)**, completed as part of the **Codebasics Resume Challenge**.
This project quantifies the decline in print, explores advertising revenue trends, evaluates digital readiness, and recommends a roadmap for digital transformation.

## 📰 Project Overview

Bharat Herald, a 70-year-old legacy newspaper, once printed **1.2M copies daily**. By 2024, circulation dropped below **560K**, advertiser trust declined, and a 2021 e-paper pilot failed.

The analysis was conducted to answer three main questions:

1. **What went wrong?**
2. **Where is the recovery potential?**
3. **What roadmap can guide Bharat Herald toward digital transformation?**

* **Ad Revenue Loss** → Nearly halved, with advertisers shifting to digital rivals.
* **Digital Readiness** → Tier-2 cities like Kanpur & Ahmedabad scored **75%+** in readiness.
* **Pilot Failure** → The 2021 e-paper app had high bounce rates and poor usability.
